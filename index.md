## Real-time rain severity detection for autonomous driving applications

Detection and severity classification of rainy conditions is an essential part of the sensor support system.In this project a novel rain detection and severity classification algorithm based on a neural network with inputs such as localized DCT and image-based features. The proposed approach is tested on real data set collected on the road and subjectively quantified with respect to rain severity.

## Real-time fog visibility range estimation for autonomous driving applications

fog visibility range estimation algorithm for autonomous driving application. The proposed method is based on a hybrid neural network for which localized image entropy and image-based features are given as an input. While entropy used for visibility estimation, image-based features act as a basis for distance calibration.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
